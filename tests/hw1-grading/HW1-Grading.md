# Autograder files

These files were used to grade homework 1.  
Additional notes, desired outputs, etc. are below.

Additionally, all tests were run both normally, as well as under valgrind.

NOTE: I believe that the "desired return value" may sometimes be negative
## test0.go

Note:  
`[expect lexical error on line 3]`

Desired return value:  
`1`

## test1.go

Note:  
`[expect normal token output]`

Desired return value:  
`0`

## test2.go

Note:  
`No note exists`

Desired return value:  
`2`

## Multifile test 1

Inputs:  
`a.go`  
`b.go`

Note:  
`multi-file test`

Desired return value:  
`2`

## Odds and Ends Test

Inputs:  
`test3.go`

Desired return value:  
`0`
